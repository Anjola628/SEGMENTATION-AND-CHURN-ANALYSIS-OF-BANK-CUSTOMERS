# Segmentation and Churn Analysis of Bank Customers

This repository contains a machine learning project for **customer segmentation and churn prediction** using real-world banking data. The goal is to build models that identify customer segments and predict which customers are most likely to churn, helping inform retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies an **end-to-end data science workflow** — from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and explainability. Key techniques include clustering, supervised machine learning, handling imbalanced data, and model interpretability.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  Used clustering techniques to group customers based on behaviour and demographic features.

- **Churn Prediction Models:**  
  Built and evaluated models including XGBoost, boosted ensembles, and a Transformer-based approach (TabPFN).

- **Imbalanced Data Handling:**  
  Applied SMOTE and feature transformation techniques for better model performance.

- **Explainable AI:**  
  Leveraged SHAP values to interpret model predictions and identify key churn drivers.
